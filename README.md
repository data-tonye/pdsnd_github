### Project Title
Explore Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, Python was used to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Code was written to import the data and interesting questions were answered about the data by computing descriptive statistics.

### Files used
Washington-CapitalBikeshare-2016
Chicago-Divvy-2016
NYC-CitiBike-2016

### Credits
This project is a requirement to finished the Programming for Data Science Nanodegree at Udacity

### Project Specifications 
- All code cells can be run without error
- Appropriate data types (e.g. strings, floats) and data structures (e.g. lists, dictionaries) are chosen to carry out the required analysis tasks
- Loops and conditional statements are used to process the data correctly
- Packages are used to carry out advanced tasks
- Functions are used to reduce repetitive code
- Docstrings, comments, and variable names enable readability of the code
- Raw input is solicited and handled correctly to guide the interactive question-answering experience; no errors are thrown when unexpected input is entered
- Descriptive statistics are correctly computed and used to answer the questions posed about the data. Raw data is displayed upon request by the user in this manner: Script should prompt the user if they want to see 5 lines of raw data, display that data if the answer is 'yes', and continue these prompts and displays until the user says 'no'
